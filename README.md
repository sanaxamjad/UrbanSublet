## Description

This web application is a subleasing platform tailored for college students seeking to lease and sublease apartments. It provides a user-friendly interface for students to post listings for available apartments, search for sublets in their desired locations, and connect with fellow students looking to sublease. Whether you're studying abroad, interning in a different city, or simply looking for a roommate, our platform streamlines the process of finding and arranging sublease agreements among college students. With features designed specifically for student needs, such as flexible lease durations and roommate matching options, we make it easy for college students to find the perfect living situation during their academic journey.
